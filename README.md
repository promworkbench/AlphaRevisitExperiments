# AlphaRevisitExperiments (Alpha Revisit Experiments (Alpha+++))


This ProM plugin contains an interactive mode of the Alpha+++ algorithm, where the individual algorithm steps as well as their options can be changed.

It allows discovering Accepting Petri Nets from Event Logs.

For more information on the Alpha+++ algorithm see [https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3424/paper4.pdf](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3424/paper4.pdf) or the updated extended report at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17767](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17767).
Please note, that the currently implemented algorithm might differ in some details from the original paper description, because of further updates or improvements.
